        <h2> Project 1: Buidling a working clock with alarm from scratch </h2>
        <p> During my time studying in the US, I worked on a course project in which we were tasked with building a clock from scratch (with provided components of course) and program it with C
            so that it'll work like a normal clock should. We also had programmed it to have a counting seconds feature, an alarm feature and a set time feature. </p>

        <h2> Project 2: Building Smart Home Devices </h2>
        <p> I've worked on projects with the purpose to build smart home devices. Despite the title, I've only fully worked on 
            1 Smart home device, the smart light system which has 2 modes, movement and clap sound detection. Movement mode uses motion sensors 
            to detect movement in the room, if it does, it'll turn on the lamp, after 1 minute of no movement, it automatically turns off. 
            Clap sound detection mode listens for sound through the audio sensor, clap twice once, it'll turn on, clap twice again and it'll turn off (this is the energy saving mode)
            Other smart home devices such as the motion sensing alarm system or the temperature and humidity meter I worked with my team in order to accomplish.</p>

        <h2> Project 3: Cinema Website</h2>
        <p> During my first semester at RMIT, I've studied the course Practical Databases that had a final project of building a product that uses/host/connected to a Database.
            Me and my team developed a Cinema website that registered user ticket information and displayed them on their account. Of course, at the time I haven't studied Web Programming yet so 
            I assisted my team in working on the back end with the SQL Queries in our databases. Despite my limited knowlege in making a fully functioning website at the time, I did manage to also 
            assist my team in our frontend, albeit, to a lesser degree.
