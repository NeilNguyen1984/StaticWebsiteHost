            <p> Previously, I've studied my first year of college in the US, attending SUNY (State University of New York) Stony Brook University and majoring in 
                Electrical Engineering. I was also a part of the IEEE (International Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Society during my time studying there. 
                Unfortunately, due to covid at the start of 2020, I had to return home, where I subsequently decided to enroll in RMIT University.</p>

            <p> I've had experience working at MoMo as an Intern in the following 2 positions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> Market Research, where I researched and reported findings of the company's current target users/demographics and findings of current market ecosystem</li>
                <li> Product Operations, where worked mostly on the app's Data Analysis and helped (a small part, as I was an intern at the time) in developing the new UI/UX of the app at the time </li>
            </ul>
