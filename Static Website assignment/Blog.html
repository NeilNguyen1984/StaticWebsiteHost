            <h3> Post 21/3/2022. My New Blog </h3>   
            <p> Currently I'm contracted with covid, and I am doing my best to work on my course 
                work and projects. I'll update on my situation more as time goes on. </p>

            <h3> Post 22/3/2022. Health improvment and ideas </h3>
            <p> I'm currently feeling a bit more conscious now, still trying to work on my course works. I've just had the idea of creating a website of updating the situation in Ukraine
                or maybe it should be helping raising awareness of something else. I also came up with the idea of a personal body temperature sensor, say if your temperature raises up to 
                a certain degree, it'll set off an alert/alarm, I'll probably use an Arduino for it. I got this idea because lately my fevers happen very inconsistently and unpredictably and it took me a bit to get the thermometer to get 
                my body temperature. </p>

            <h3> Post 23/3/2022. Course work and possible project idea </h3>
            <p> My fever and head has improved quite alot now, although I still have throat and nasal issues. I worry that one of my assignments will be submitted in late, and I can't ask for another extension
                but I'd rather submit a finished work than an unfinished one. Other than that, I came up with an idea to create and and program a 3D printer using a microcontroller like Arduino. 
                Unfortunately, one search simple search and it turns out it's already been done, although none of them have frame materials that I imagined. It'll still an interesting project to work on though, along with a 3D scanner. </p>
